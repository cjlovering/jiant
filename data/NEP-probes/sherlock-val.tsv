This press, as I have already explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the subject.	We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans.	sherlock	False	False
When he told us of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride’s manner, of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very significant allusion to claim-jumping—which in miners’ parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to—the whole situation became absolutely clear.	She had gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband—	sherlock	False	False
But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature.	"On the other hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self-respect."""	sherlock	False	False
"There’s twenty-six of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen for the market.’ """	"‘Thank you, Maggie,’ says I; ‘but if it is all the same to you, I’d rather have that one I was handling just now.’ """	sherlock	False	False
If this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind.	But since we see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly, which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature.	sherlock	False	False
"""Then, for pity’s sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister’s death."""	"""I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."""	sherlock	False	False
It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea.	The daughter told us as much.	sherlock	False	False
Her jacket was black, with black beads sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments.	Her dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves.	sherlock	False	False

But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me	was more than I could suffer.	sherlock	False	False
The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens, began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones.	A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket.	sherlock	False	False
No doubt you will go to the prison to see James.	"Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do tell him that I know him to be innocent."""	sherlock	False	False
She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face, freckled like a plover’s egg, and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way to make in the world.	"""You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure,"" said she, as my companion rose to greet her, ""but I have had a very strange experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do."""	sherlock	False	False
It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given.	It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.	sherlock	False	False
No one knows a word of the matter, but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows to be absolutely impossible.	It was sheer frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father, at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner.	sherlock	False	False
""" Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where we found lunch upon the table."	Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.	sherlock	False	False
"""That is not always so easy."""	"""I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes."	sherlock	False	False
"""I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was"	I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor.	sherlock	False	False
And you know where they are.	Must I call you a liar as well as a thief?	sherlock	False	False
But look at these lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law.	Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on, year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser.	sherlock	False	False
"My dear fellow,"" said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, ""life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent."	We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence.	sherlock	False	False
On the other hand, if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers.	Inspector Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities.	sherlock	False	False
His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking.	Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice, little birds, and insects.	sherlock	False	False
It was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere.

"""There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end."	Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third of which were open.	sherlock	False	False
"""It is simplicity itself,"" said he; ""my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts."	Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.	sherlock	False	False
his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is weighed down with some great anxiety.	"""I owe you an apology,"" he said, raising his golden pince-nez to his eyes."	sherlock	False	False
"And then I think that what he foresaw happened."""	"""But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"""	sherlock	False	False
Now, for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster all our resources.	Kindly hand me down the letter K of the _American Encyclopædia_ which stands upon the shelf beside you.	sherlock	False	False
I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this snow.	That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who takes very little exercise.	sherlock	False	False
In the surgeon’s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon.	I marked the spot upon my own head.	sherlock	False	False
The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred to the Assizes.	I have some account of the matter here, I believe.	sherlock	False	False
we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath.	My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit’s end.	sherlock	False	False
"""I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."""	"""You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright."""	sherlock	False	False

"""Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."""	Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.	sherlock	False	False

As he loved his cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should retain her secret—the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one.	"When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture became a certainty. """	sherlock	False	False
For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser.

"""He has come back and done it."	I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man.	sherlock	False	False
"""I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my records."""	"""You have erred, perhaps,"" he observed, taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood—""you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing."""	sherlock	False	False
"Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections."""	"""Here is the first notice which I can find."	sherlock	False	False
If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap.	Easier the other way, perhaps; and yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon me?	sherlock	False	False
"It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station.’ """	‘Then we can hardly get there before midnight.	sherlock	False	False

It was nearly ten o’clock before he entered, looking pale and worn.	He walked up to the sideboard, and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously, washing it down with a long draught of water.	sherlock	False	False
"""Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"""	"""Yes, there are nearly always some there."""	sherlock	False	False
He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought.	Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a desultory chat with me over his business affairs.	sherlock	False	False

Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan.	Pray step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know.	sherlock	False	False
A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks.	Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but, just as he reached her, he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face.	sherlock	False	False
"I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I made him keep the appointment."""	"""But with no very good result,"" I remarked."	sherlock	False	False

All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.	It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence.	sherlock	False	False
Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate.	Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset.	sherlock	False	False
The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.	"""What do you make of that, Watson?"""	sherlock	False	False
"""The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn."	That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke.	sherlock	False	False
I lay listening with all my ears.	Suddenly, to my horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room.	sherlock	False	False
I had been told that, if the King employed an agent, it would certainly be you.	And your address had been given me.	sherlock	False	False
Presently he came to himself once more, very weary and pale-looking.	"""I have been making a fool of myself,"" he gasped."	sherlock	False	False
He has not been home for two days.	I am so frightened about him!	sherlock	False	False
"—how long had he been with you?"""	"""About a month then."" ""How did he come?"""	sherlock	False	False
It was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones.	It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.	sherlock	False	False

We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.	"""We are close there now,"" my friend remarked. """	sherlock	False	False
I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister’s house.	She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton Road, where she fattened fowls for the market.	sherlock	False	False
I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position.	Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away these bleak autumnal evenings.	sherlock	False	False

Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.	But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself.	sherlock	False	False
He slipped his key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell.	The sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep slumber.	sherlock	False	False

It was no wonder that no one was stirring.	It was twenty-five minutes past four.	sherlock	False	False
Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.	They got £ 4700 for the goodwill and interest, which wasn’t near as much as father could have got if he had been alive.	sherlock	False	False

There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the Franco-Prussian War.	It is one of these cases—but, hullo, here is Lestrade!	sherlock	False	False

His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he bent her to his will.	I have no doubt that she loved you, but there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves, and I think that she must have been one.	sherlock	False	False
She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch awaited us upon the table.	"""I am so delighted that you have come,"" she said earnestly."	sherlock	False	False
Sherlock Holmes was a man, however, who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient.	It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all-night sitting.	sherlock	False	False
There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all.	A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.	sherlock	False	False
I have already arranged what is to occur.	There is only one point on which I must insist.	sherlock	False	False
The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De Quincey’s description of his dreams and sensations, he had drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects.	He found, as so many more have done, that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives.	sherlock	False	False
"""I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,"" he said."	"""Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a hard-headed British jury."""	sherlock	False	False
The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor’s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.

In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin.	The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.	sherlock	False	False

Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to me—seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also—but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank.

He drank more than ever, and he was less inclined for any sort of society.	Most of his time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man, and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by man or devil.	sherlock	False	False
Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last, having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.	"""At the same time,"" he remarked after a pause, during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire, ""you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense, at all."	sherlock	False	False
James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel.	Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past.	sherlock	False	False
"""I suppose,"" said Holmes, ""that when Mr. Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."""	"""Oh, well, he was very good about it."	sherlock	False	False

Her prolonged absence having caused some comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage.	One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress, believing her to be with the company.	sherlock	False	False

Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate.	It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses.	sherlock	False	False
Well, the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used.	It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you.	sherlock	False	False

His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long, sinewy neck.	His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick, impatient snarl in reply.	sherlock	False	False
Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of voices from above.	"On entering his room, I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men, one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.

We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence.	"If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most _outré_ results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable."""	sherlock	False	False

So Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them.	It is likely that we should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret.	sherlock	False	False

The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth.	To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged.	sherlock	False	False

It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant.	The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected.	sherlock	False	False
He was, as the inspector had said, extremely dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness.	A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a perpetual snarl.	sherlock	False	False

"""Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor man, the loss was a heavy one."	He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird.	sherlock	False	False
A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.	There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall.	sherlock	False	False

In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.	Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage.	sherlock	False	False

By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at all.	Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk the loss of it.	sherlock	False	False
"""How could they have decoyed him down there?"	The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station.	sherlock	False	False
In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him.

John Horner, 26, plumber, was brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst., abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle.

Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation.

A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats.

He had for years been known as a professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one.

The bride, who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room.

I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.	Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries.	sherlock	False	False
