Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.	Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this.	sherlock	False	False

He took off his coat and waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs.	With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.	sherlock	False	False

Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.	He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road.	sherlock	False	False
It was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the wintry sun.	Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and on the heaped-up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell.	sherlock	False	False

The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage.	It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work.	sherlock	False	False
Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an admirable opportunity.	I turned the key gently in the lock, opened the door, and slipped through.	sherlock	False	False

He ran up and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood.	Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction.	sherlock	False	False
I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland.

I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material.	She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand.	sherlock	False	False

I married, too, and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.	Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done.	sherlock	False	False
It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the _dénouement_ of the little mystery.	I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair.	sherlock	False	False
Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business.	He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it.	sherlock	False	False
It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of exercising enormous pressure.	When I passed outside, however, and pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders.	sherlock	False	False

But now the spell had been upon him eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects.	There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane.	sherlock	False	False

He and the two mates, are as I learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship.	The others are Finns and Germans.	sherlock	False	False
It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you.	You knew that this man Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.	sherlock	False	False

It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be difficult to suggest a better.	The method was no doubt suggested to Clay’s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice’s hair.	sherlock	False	False

Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.	Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day.	sherlock	False	False

"""He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott’s conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death."

She had a considerable sum of money—not less than £ 1000 a year—and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage.	Shortly after our return to England my mother died—she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe.	sherlock	False	False

With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front of him.	In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him, silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set aquiline features.	sherlock	False	False

He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end.	He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master.	sherlock	False	False

The year ’87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest, of which I retain the records.	Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the British barque _Sophy Anderson_, of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case.	sherlock	False	False

I confess that the guilt of the banker’s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such faith in Holmes’ judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation.

They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House.	At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him.	sherlock	False	False
"""When I arrived at the house,"" continued Holmes, ""I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me."

He would seize the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink.

The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning.

Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage.	The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice.	sherlock	False	False

His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and firmness.	As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so important, to raise his hand as if to strike him.	sherlock	False	False

It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back.

Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in the sitting-room at Baker Street.	Nothing had been said during our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous tension within him.	sherlock	False	False
When he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits.

A chair had been placed close to the central window, with its back turned towards it.	In this I was asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to.	sherlock	False	False
Not a word of news came for a year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead.

I felt, however, that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence.

Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson’s presence—in other words, that they had completed their tunnel.

I was a young chap then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber.

The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes.	"He shot a questioning glance at each of us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair. """	sherlock	False	False
He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer.	They were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions.	sherlock	False	False

"""This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases."	"Whom have I the honour to address?"""	sherlock	False	False

No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted.	Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter.	sherlock	False	False
Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.

"""It is a little off the beaten track, isn’t it?"" said he. """	And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes.	sherlock	False	False
It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red.	In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history.	sherlock	False	False
"The most serious point in the case is the disposition of the child."""	"""What on earth has that to do with it?"" I ejaculated."	sherlock	False	False
"""And what of Irene Adler?"" I asked."	"""Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part."	sherlock	False	False
he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all over with bloodstains.	He was young, not more than five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his strength of mind to control.	sherlock	False	False
"Ferguson remained outside, and the colonel ushered me in. """	‘We are now,’ said he, ‘actually within the hydraulic press, and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on.	sherlock	False	False
but I can’t get the end of it into my hand.	"Now, I’ll state the case clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me."""	sherlock	False	False
I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he would not have talked so.	"And then I think that what he foresaw happened."""	sherlock	False	False
For the rest, it was cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places, although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.	"""I can see nothing,"" said I, handing it back to my friend."	sherlock	False	False
It will end in my being conveyed into the house.	Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open.	sherlock	False	False
‘I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,’ I answered.	‘But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again.	sherlock	False	False

"He was such a comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at him. """	‘You are looking for a situation, miss?’	sherlock	False	False
I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise—the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me whether it answered to the description of any of their travellers.	I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here.	sherlock	False	False
McCarthy kept two servants—a man and a girl.	Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the least.	sherlock	False	False
SHERLOCK HOLMES,—Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion.	I have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding.	sherlock	False	False
They could only have come from the old man at my side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers.	I took two steps forward and looked back.	sherlock	False	False
You see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more important and less innocent aspect.	Here is the stone; the stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you.	sherlock	False	False
"""No, he was averse to it also."	"No one but Mr. McCarthy was in favour of it."""	sherlock	False	False
"However, when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.

"""Quite so,"" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair."	"""You see, but you do not observe."	sherlock	False	False
He throws it out, and would have done the same with the other garments	"had not he heard the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the window when the police appeared."""	sherlock	False	False
"The point about the signature is very suggestive—in fact, we may call it conclusive."""	"""Of what?"" ""My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case?"""	sherlock	False	False
"""Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present."	I think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our web to weave, while theirs is already woven.	sherlock	False	False

muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope.	"""There are one or two very singular points about this room."	sherlock	False	False
It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round shape, hard and much the worse for wear.	The lining had been of red silk, but was a good deal discoloured.	sherlock	False	False
"""It is nothing very formidable,"" he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket."	"""It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting."	sherlock	False	False
He was kind to her also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they seemed to be a happy couple.	And yet she had some secret sorrow, this woman.	sherlock	False	False
Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow.	He wore rather baggy grey shepherd’s check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament.	sherlock	False	False
The road is an important highway, and there are usually people there.	This man, however, was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up.	sherlock	False	False

"""Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,"" murmured Holmes without opening his eyes."

What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was!	I did not wonder at Lestrade’s opinion, and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes’ insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young McCarthy’s innocence.	sherlock	False	False
"""He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man."	"Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others."""	sherlock	False	False
I observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French.	It is introspective, and I want to introspect.	sherlock	False	False

At dusk we saw Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him.

We found him, when we went to search for him, face downward in a little green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden.	There was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep, so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity, brought in a verdict of ‘suicide.’	sherlock	False	False
"""I have been at some small expense over this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the Red-headed League."""	"""You see, Watson,"" he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, ""it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League, and the copying of the _Encyclopædia_, must be to get this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day."	sherlock	False	False
The lady, I think, you have already met.	""" At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended dignity."	sherlock	False	False
I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it.	By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard.	sherlock	False	False
He had remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been called away.

The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we reached it	we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from the one beneath.	sherlock	False	False
He brought up a card, too, with the name of ‘Colonel Lysander Stark’ engraved upon it.	Close at his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle size, but of an exceeding thinness.	sherlock	False	False

Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us.	We stepped, as it were, right out of the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house.	sherlock	False	False
